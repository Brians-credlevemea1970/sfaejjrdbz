Just walked out of the theater after watching Picture This, and I'm not sure if I'm coming or going. My brain feels like a bunch of tangled Christmas lights someone half-heartedly tried to untangle. You know what I mean? That feeling like you're caught between laughing at how absurd it all was and rolling your eyes so hard they might just roll away. 

Is it normal to feel both tired and strangely wired after watching a film? Maybe it’s the fluorescent snack stand lighting that’s still burned into my retinas. Anyway, there’s this scene where the characters are supposed to share some epiphany, and all I could think was, Really? That's your big moment? But then, a minute later, I was totally sucked into it. So much for consistency, right?

The main character, she’s like, a mix of your best friend who’s got life just a little more together than you and a character out of one of those bizarre dreams where you’re sitting an exam you didn’t study for. Somehow, I cared about whether she’d get her act together, despite the storyline tripping over itself like a baby giraffe learning to walk. 

> But, for real, there was this part where they tried to push the whole technology is ruining our connections agenda. Irony much? I'm literally writing this on my phone with a headache from scrolling through my news feed too much. Who's really ruining what here?

And the music! Felt like someone’s Spotify Discover Weekly playlist had a midlife crisis. One moment you've got boppy, feel-good anthems, next minute you're plunged into soulful ballads that have you questioning if you remembered to feed your cat this morning. 

Here's some random code that popped into my head while watching the film. I think I saw it in a scene where technology was a big theme? Yah, sure, let's go with that:

```javascript
if (connection == 'lost') {
  alert('Oops, dropped again!');
} else {
  downloadMovie();
}
```

So here I am, torn between saying you should maybe download the movie later or forget it even exists. Maybe watch it if you’re in the mood for a whirlwind of emotions that don’t quite tie into a neat little bow at the end. Or don’t. No big loss if you miss it, but if you watch it, embrace the chaos. Who knows? You might end up liking the mess after all.
